## AB-Testing

### What is A/B Testing?

A/B Testing involves comparing two versions of a single variable (for example two versions of a single app page/web page). Version A as the current version (the ‘Control’), while version B as the modified page (the ‘Test’). By running both pages simultaneously, you can easily see which one generates more sales or sign-ups or interaction.

Running A/B tests is the only way to optimize a website with certainty. For the most well-known digital brands, testing is a constant process that guides their web development. However, since the introduction of tools like Optimizely and VWO in 2010, A/B testing has also become an important part of digital marketing.

Testing has one major advantage over alternative ways of optimizing a website: it is based on real users. Whilst UX design, best-practice guidelines and customer journey analysis can provide hints and suggestions, real-world testing offers certainty.

- E-commerce websites use it to strengthen their conversion funnel
- Saas websites use it to improve their home page and enhance their sign-up process
- Lead generation websites use it to optimize their landing pages.
